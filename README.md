Android app to count down to a particular time/date.

There are tons of Android countdown apps... but they all count down a time period such as 2 hours, or 15 minutes.

I was interested in the time remaining until a rocket launch, and discovered there are no apps that count down to a specific date and time, such as 2:25pm on the 21st of May.

I slapped this together and it's got a pretty primitive UI, but it does the job.

Select the date using the date button at the top (next to the today shortcut button)

Select the time using the number and am/pm selectors

The time-remaining will display at the bottom.

This doesn't do any alarms, nor does it have a place to note the upcoming event.
